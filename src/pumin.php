      <p class="text-justify">
        Porter Robinson is an American electronic music producer, singer, and DJ known for his emotive and
        genre-blending sound. Born on July 15, 1992, in Atlanta, Georgia, he gained prominence with his 2011 single
        "Language" and debut album <em>Worlds</em> (2014), which showcased a unique blend of electronic, synth-pop, and
        indie elements. Robinson's music often explores themes of nostalgia, escapism, and personal growth. He released
        the critically acclaimed album <em>Nurture</em> in 2021, marking a shift to a more introspective and organic
        sound. Robinson is also part of the duo Virtual Self, known for its futuristic, rave-inspired music.
